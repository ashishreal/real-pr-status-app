# Cache Implementation Summary

## What was implemented:

### Backend (real-pr-status-app)
1. **Cache Module** (`app/cache.py`):
   - In-memory cache with TTL support
   - Cache statistics tracking (hits, misses, sets, evictions)
   - Decorator for easy function caching
   - Automatic expiration handling
   - Periodic cleanup task

2. **GitHub Service Updates** (`app/github_service.py`):
   - Manual caching in `fetch_developer_prs()` - 30 minute TTL
   - Manual caching in `fetch_all_developer_prs()` - 30 minute TTL
   - Cache key generation based on username/developer list

3. **API Endpoints** (`app/main.py`):
   - Added `/api/cache/stats` - returns cache statistics
   - Added `/api/cache/clear` - clears all cache
   - Automatic cache cleanup task on startup

### Frontend (real-pr-status-web)
Frontend currently does not have cache management UI implemented yet. This can be added as a future enhancement.

## How it works:
1. First API call fetches from GitHub and caches results for 30 minutes
2. Subsequent calls use cached data (improving performance and reducing GitHub API usage)
3. Cache is keyed by developer username for individual PR fetches
4. Cache is keyed by sorted developer list for bulk fetches
5. After 30 minutes, cache expires automatically
6. Periodic cleanup task runs every 5 minutes to remove expired entries
7. Cache statistics available via `/api/cache/stats` endpoint

## Benefits:
- Reduces GitHub API rate limit consumption
- Improves response times for repeated requests
- Provides visibility into cache performance
- Allows manual cache clearing when needed

## Testing:
Created test file `app/test_cache.py` with comprehensive tests for:
- Basic cache operations
- TTL expiration
- Cache clearing
- Decorator functionality
- Statistics calculation
