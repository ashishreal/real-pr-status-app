Create a plan to build complete app with backend code in python and frontend code in Ionic. This app maintains a config of developer github names. It fetches all the open
  pull requests for these developers. From pull request it extracts details: created_at, resolved review comments, unresolved review comments, first review comment date, last
  review comment date, reviewer names. I don't want any database integration. Python config file should maintain the list of developer github names. I just need a functionality to fetch the open pull request details when button on the front end UI is clicked.
